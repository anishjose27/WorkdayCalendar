**Workday Calculator:**

This is a Workday Calendar application designed to accurately determine the date and time resulting from adding or subtracting a specified number of working days to/from a given date.

The WinForms application takes the start date, the number of days, and the desired operation as input.

**Holiday management:**

The system considers all weekends as holidays and operates during default working hours of 08:00-16:00.

Optionally, users can customize recurring/non-recurring holidays and working hours to suit their needs.

Holiday details are stored in JSON format, and the file locations can be configured using the App.Config file. 
Sample holiday lists are included, and these files are automatically generated upon first-time data saving.

**Unit Tests:**

Unit test cases are added for different scenarios and based on the sample holiday list provided.
